High-quality types can help improve projects' maintainability while avoiding potential bugs.
There are a bunch of awesome type utility libraries may boost your works on types, like [ts-toolbelt](https://github.com/millsp/ts-toolbelt), [utility-types](https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types), [SimplyTyped](https://github.com/andnp/SimplyTyped), etc., which you can already use.
This project is aimed at helping you better understand how the type system works, writing your own utilities, or just having fun with the challenges. We are also trying to form a community where you can ask questions and get answers you have faced in the real world - they may become part of the challenges!
